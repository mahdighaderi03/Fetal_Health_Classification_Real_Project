# Fetal_Health_Classification_Real_Project
Fetal health status is categorized based on CTG data into three classifications: normal, suspicious, or pathological.

Promoting child survival is a pivotal objective outlined in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, underscoring human progress globally. The UN envisions a world by 2030 where preventable deaths among newborns and children under the age of 5 are eradicated. The target is for all nations to strive for an under‑5 mortality rate as low as 25 per 1,000 live births.

Alongside the focus on child mortality is the pressing issue of maternal mortality, which accounted for 295,000 deaths during and after pregnancy and childbirth as of 2017. Tragically, the majority of these deaths (94%) occurred in resource-limited regions, and most could have been averted with adequate healthcare measures.

In this context, Cardiotocograms (CTGs) emerge as a vital, uncomplicated, and economically accessible tool for evaluating fetal health. They empower healthcare professionals to intervene proactively, thereby preventing both child and maternal mortality. CTG equipment operates by emitting ultrasound pulses and analyzing their responses, providing crucial insights into fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions, and more.

# Dataset Overview:
This dataset comprises 2,126 meticulously recorded instances extracted from Cardiotocogram exams. These records were judiciously classified into three categories – Normal, Suspect, and Pathological – by a panel of three expert obstetricians.
